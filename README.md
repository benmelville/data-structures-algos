# Data Structures and Algorithms



### About
This is a repo with the basic data structures and algorithms. We will start from singly linked lists and make our 
ways to solving real world problems with algorithms and runtime analysis. 

This readme will be updated with each 
project as we progress. 


### How to use
Each data structure, algorithm, and problem will have their own dedicated directory. In each of these directories I 
will encourage you to read the README.md first to give some background knowledge about the subject. Then you should 
look at the starter code and try and implement it yourself.
